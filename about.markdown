Hey there! :wave:

I'm Walker Clem, a Computer Science senior at UNC Charlotte on track to graduate in Fall 2023. I've been actively involved in the realm of software since 2019 and have been fortunate to pursue it academically and professionally ever since. In this ever-evolving tech landscape, I'm all about learning and adapting to the latest technologies.

Feel free to explore my blog posts to learn what I'm currently up to!
